School Project Created by Mike, Rodel and Myself(Isho).

The website is a simple react application that utilized the Genius API from Rapid API(Currently a Locked API)

The website would allow the user to enter an artists name into the search bar & present the user with the top 5 songs that artist was on.

The user was able to route to a page that would display the lyrics to a song,
visit the artists Genius webpage, 
and reroute to a link where the audio could be played back to the user.
